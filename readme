This folder includes all data presented in the paper "Boundary Vector Cells in the Goldfish Central Telencehpalon Encode Spatial Information" by Cohen et. al 2023 (PLOS Biology) 

Each data file correspond to a specific figure and opened in MATLAB.

Each .mat file is a structure correpond to different panels in the manuscript. 
The structure indices and corresponding panels are fully detailed in the file "data indices.xls"

e.g., to get the heatmap data shown in Figure 2 panel B use the foloowing steps:
1. open Matlab
2. navigate to the files directory
3. run the following commands:
    load('Fig2_data.mat');
    Heatmap_data=Fig2_data{1,2}{1,1};
